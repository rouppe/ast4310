# Introduction

These pages contain a description of AST4310 and additional resources. The pages [at the University web site](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/astro/AST4310/h21/index.html) will still be updated (in particular the messages), but the bulk of the materials will be linked here.

## Practicalities

- Four hours of lectures and two hours of exercise classes per week (see [calendar](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/astro/AST4310/h21/timeplan/index.html))
- Classes will be held in person unless otherwise directed
- See separate page for [syllabus and literature](literature/)
- The [course's github repository](https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310) contains all project notebooks, and will be populated with additional resources as the semester progresses


## Communication
- We will use the Institute's forum [Astro Discourse](https://astro-discourse.utenforuio.no/) for communication. You need to register before starting to use the forum. Please use your real name when registering so we can make sure only real UiO students use the forum (anonymous posting is possible after registering). Look for the [AST4310](https://astro-discourse.utenforuio.no/c/ast4310/6) category. 

## Assessment

The final grade is determined by an assessment of six projects. The following table lists deadlines for handing in each project, how much each project weighs in the final grade, and the topic of each project. More details can be found under [projects](projects/). You need to take only one of the options of Project 6.

|        | Deadline          | Weight  |  Topic  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :----:|:---|
| [Project 1](https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project1)     | 10.09.2021 | 5% | Basic spectral line formation |
| [Project 2](https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project2)    | 24.09.2021 | 15% | Line strengths and curve of growth |
| [Project 3](https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project3)     | 08.10.2021 | 20% | *La Palma* |
| [Project 4](https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project4)     | 29.10.2021 | 20% | Solar stratification and continua |
| [Project 5](https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project5)     | 19.11.2021 | 20% | LTE line formation |
| Project 6     | 17.12.2021 | 20% | *Different options:* |
| <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project6a">Project 6a</a></li></ul>    | | | <ul><li>3D Radiative Transfer</li></ul>|
| <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project6b">Project 6b</a></li></ul>   | | | <ul><li>Scattering</li></ul> |
| <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tiagopereira/ast4310/tree/main/notebooks/project6c">Project 6c</a></li></ul>   | | | <ul><li>Polarised Radiative Transfer</li></ul> |

## Required software and tools

This course will have a strong computational component. Computations are not the end goal, but they will be an important tool to understand the topics we will cover. Research in astrophysics is becoming more and more computational; the course will equip students with the strategies and skills to deal with modern astrophysical problems. 

Students are expected to have their own laptops, and bring them to classes (including lectures!). We will make use of [JuputerHub](https://jupyterhub.uio.no/user/home/lab), so all you need to run the examples, exercises, and projects is a computer with internet access! 

The projects are in Jupyter notebook format. Only two programming languages are allowed: **Python** or **Julia**. In the classes we will make extensive use of Jupyter lab. More details about the software and computing environment can be found in [software and tools](tools/).

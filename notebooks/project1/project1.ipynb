She applied the newly-derived Saha distribution for different ionisation stages of an element to stellar spectra, finding that the empirical Harvard classification represents primarily a temperature scale. Her work crowned efforts of Saha, Russell, Fowler, Milne, Pannekoek and others along the same lines. It illustrates that detailed physics, in this case atomic physics, is usually needed to explain cosmic phenomena.\n",

Another necessary ingredient is the Ca abundance relative to hydrogen. In the Sun, this is about 2x10$^{-6}$.

Plot in a log scale the relative population changes for the lower levels of Ca$^+$K and H$\\alpha$ vs. temperature, using  $\\Delta T=$ 1 K. Around $T=$ 5600 K the Ca$^+$K curve dips down to very  small values; the H$\\alpha$ curve does that around $T=$ 9500  K.

Compare these plots with plots of the populations of the lower levels for the two lines (normalise them to the maximum value of each for easier comparison).

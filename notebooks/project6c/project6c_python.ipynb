    "\n",
    "Polarisation is a hidden property of radiation. In addition to intensity, observing the polarisation state of radiation allows for additional diagnostics of astrophysical media. The two main sources of polarisation in astrophysics are scattering polarisation and magnetic fields (via the Zeeman effect). In this project, you will explore simple solutions of polarised radiative transfer assuming only Zeeman effect. You will build on the work you did in Project 4 and 5, and explore the validity of commonly-used solutions and approximations. Throughout this project, you will work under the assumption of LTE ($S_\\nu = B_\\nu(T)$, and use of Saha-Boltzmann to obtain atomic populations).\n",

    "### 1.1 Zeeman Effect\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zeeman effect is the splitting of magnetic levels due to an external magnetic field. The strength and pattern of the splitting depend on the electronic configuration of the upper and lower levels. For any splitting to occur, the total angular momentum quantum number $J$ needs to be larger than zero. The splitting of a given level occurs for different values of the secondary total angular momentum quantum number $M_j$ (the projections of $J$ over an arbitrary z axis): $M_j = -J, \\cdots, J$, so there are $2J + 1$ splits on a given level. Any transitions need to obey the electric dipole selection rule of $\\Delta M_j = 0, \\pm1$. The amount of splitting in energy is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta E_B = \\mu_B B (g^uM_j^u-g^lM_j^l),\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_B \\equiv \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and $g^u$ and $g^l$ are the Landé factors for the upper and lower levels, for LS coupling given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "g = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{J(J+1) + S(S+1) - L(L+1)}{J(J+1)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For $J=0$, $g=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In wavelength, the Zeeman splitting is given by:\n",

    "\\lambda = \\lambda_0 - \\Delta\\lambda_B (g^uM_j^u-g^lM_j^l),\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $S=0$ or $g^u=g^l$, we have only three Zeeman components, a regime called normal Zeeman effect. These components correspond to the three scenarios of the selection rule $\\Delta M_j = 0, \\pm1$, and are called $\\pi$ ($\\Delta M_j=0$), $\\sigma_r$ ($\\Delta M_j=+1$), and $\\sigma_b$ ($\\Delta M_j=-1$). For other situations, we have the so-called anomalous Zeeman effect. For transitions with a complex splitting pattern, the effective Landé factor $\\bar{g}$ is a useful concept. It measures the distance between $\\lambda_0$ and \"centre of gravity\" of the $\\sigma$ components, and is defined as:\n",

    "\\end{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the anomalous Zeeman effect, not all components have the same strength. This strength is often called $S_q^{J^l J^u}$, is dependent on $q=\\Delta M_j$, and $J$ for the upper and lower levels. The $S_q^{J^l J^u}$ are tabulated in [de la Cruz Rodriguez & van Noort (2017, Table 1, page 116)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017SSRv..210..109D/abstract), and are coded in the function `zeeman_strength()` below. \n",

    "Each Zeeman component gives rise to one line profile. These are often called $\\phi_-$, $\\phi_0$, and $\\phi_+$, respectively for $\\Delta M_j=-1, 0, 1$, and can be written, for the normal Zeeman effect (assuming no macroscopic velocities):\n",

For some of the questions below you will need to compute the disk-centre intensity for those two lines with the FALC model, in a similar fashion to what you did for the Na I D$_1$ line in Project 5. Feel free to use the same routines and code you used earlier (e.g. to compute populations from Saha-Boltzmann and line extinction). Here are a few simplifications to make that task easier. Fe I and Ti I are larger atoms than Na I. They are not hydrogenic, have more valence electrons, and a lot more levels.

These atom files have only the transition levels, and the ground levels of neutral and ionised species, and therefore are not suitable to compute the partition functions. To compute the partition functions $U_r$, it is recommended you use the recipe from Gray (2005) in the code below, and do not rely on building model atoms and calculating $U_r$ as in previous projects. The `temp_tab` array below gives the tabulated temperature, and `log_u_XX` gives $\\log_{10}U_r(T)$ for a given species. To get the partition functions at any temperature, you need only to interpolate these tables. "

This range can be found in a similar way to what you did in Project 5 where you computed the height of formation of radiation at different wavelengths. You can obtain the range of formation heights of a line by computing the height of formation for two wavelengths, one in the far wings and another at the very line core (e.g. use equation (4) from Project 5). In the case of the Ti I line, the range of formation between wings and core is much narrower, as the line extinction is not much larger than the continuum extinction. For this line, you may have to adjust the range of formation heights to obtain a similar intensity in Unno-Rachkovsky as in the formal solver of Project 5 (in this case, it is ok to adjust the range until the two profiles are roughly similar).\n",
